Chit-Chat about #IoT is becoming noisy, automation is part of it. So we couldn't delay SoulissApp APIs any longer, even doubting anyone will ever use them.

Tasker and [Automate](http://llamalab.com/automate/) are two popular tool to automate thing, they already implement any sort of complex and integrated behaviour so that we only had to figure out how to integrate them.

For now, the bare "send command" syntax is supported, but more will come if some kind of interest is found among users. 
We have a growing wiki page dedicated to SoulissApp integrations.
