[Chit-Chat](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/22/creepy-iot-3-ways-to-automate-halloween/) about #IoT is becoming noisy, automation being part of it. So we couldn't delay SoulissApp APIs any longer, even doubting anyone will ever use them. [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/) and [Automate](http://llamalab.com/automate/) are two popular tools to automate thing, they already implement any sort of complex and integrated behaviour so that we only had to figure out how to integrate them. Now you can open window blinds shaking your phone. Neat? Please let us know about creative and weird Tasker profiles you may be using with souliss.

![Automate Send Intent](http://souliss.net/images/soulissapp/Screenshot_2015-10-27-23-05-52.png)

For now, the bare "send command" syntax is supported, but more will come if some kind of interest is found among users. 
We have a growing [wiki page](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/SoulissApp-API) dedicated to SoulissApp integrations.
