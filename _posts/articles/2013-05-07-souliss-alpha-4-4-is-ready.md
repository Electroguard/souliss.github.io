As we discussed some days ago, we completed the integration of Olimex's board (the Arduino compatible ones) in the framework extending support to the relay MOD-IO board and the LED Strip controller MOD-RGB, the code wasn't released at that date because we were working hard on some news that you can see directly.

The website has a new style and is now designed to give a better understanding of what Souliss does and most important we have a new wiki, contents are now updated and integrated to cover one of the big miss of our previous one. A new [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/Getting%20Started%20with%20Souliss) with more details on the configuration steps and a better coverage of the [Examples](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/Examples) give now a straight way to runs Souliss quickly.

This release is most probably the last in the 4, next months we will move to Alpha 5 with some disruptive additions: including discovering and auto-configuration functionality and some revision in the event based mechanisms. Those are for us a big step further and will require some time, because now we are still at design stage and we won't take some decision too fast.

In the while, we will spent more times on documentation (the wiki is the first step) and try to spread Souliss over to get more user and audience, on this in next days we will annouce a cooperation that make us proud of.

In the while, [get](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/Downloads) Souliss A4.4 and have fun!

Stay tuned,
The Souliss Team.
