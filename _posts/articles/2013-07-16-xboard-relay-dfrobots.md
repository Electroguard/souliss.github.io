Starting from next release (Alpha 4.5) the [XBoard Relay](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&filter_name=xboard%20relay&product_id=837#.UeWuJG3I8UE) from DFRobot will be supported in Souliss, with full features. This is a cheap and effective relay board, including an ATmega32U4 (same as Arduino Leonardo) and a Wiznet W5100 as Ethernet transceiver.

The XBoard series include also a XBee socket that turns the board into a Ethernet to wireless bridge, is in our next plans to include also XBee drivers.

There are several boards at DFRobots that are interesting for our project, in the future we will evaluate with them the support for additional hardware solution.

Souliss release Alpha 4.5 will be released soon, or can be obtained as preview on our [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/souliss).

Stay tuned!
