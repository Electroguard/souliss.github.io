Joseph has just shared this nice video, is a Souliss based automation system that controls standard lights and LED strips, you can see a set of hand-made PCB that are used for the Souliss boards. He is a professional in electronics and is designing for the project a Battery Operated Board that is now available on GitHub with a CC Share Alike license.

The 3D model in the below picture is a preview of the board, we are now working to build a small batch in order to test those prototypes and then provide a fully tested design.

You can get the source files on out [souliss/board](https://github.com/souliss/boards) GitHub account!
