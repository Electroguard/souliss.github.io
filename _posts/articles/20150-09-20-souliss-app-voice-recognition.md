From version 1.5.4 you can use your voice to issue commands to Souliss. After having enabled the relevant option, tap on the mic icon and use one of the following:

    [<turn on>|<turn off>|<open>|<close>] [(deviceName)+]
    [<execute> <scene>] [sceneName | sceneId]

You should talk in the same language of your android device, using keyword to activate massive commands. More devices can be enumerated within a single voice command: the same output command will be sent to each one of them. Renaming devices is suggested in order to ease the recognition process.

Other bug were fixed, TAG section should now be almost ok. You can now sort TAGSs, save them with backup function and restore as needed. Fahreneit temperatures have been added, even though the process of converting every temperature to this unit is not complete.
