Yesterday I got from our friend at [KMP Electronics](http://kmpelectronics.eu/) this picture, the PCB for the Sensor Battery Board has arrived in their facilities and the assembly of the first prototypes will soon start.

>This board can stand a year or more on LiPo battery, the design remove all unnecessarily power waste while the module is in sleep, and the support for battery devices in Souliss will keep the usage simple.

In battery only mode the board will use the 2.4 GHz nRF24L01 radio, a socket of the ESP8266 is available to build a bridge that collect all the other boards. Is even possible use the ESP8266 while on battery, with a reduced battery life due to the higher consumption of the WiFi module.

Stay Tuned!
