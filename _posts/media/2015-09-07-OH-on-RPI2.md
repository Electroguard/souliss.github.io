This tutorial has been written in occasion of my OH installation on a brand new RPi2 model B.
It is meant to be a step by step guide to help myself (and others) in case of new installations.

# Purchasing the hardware

I had a RPi1 model B already running in my apartment with OpenHAB and other backup services.
It was running not very fine, mainly suffering from the slow CPU trying to run the JVM.
On that machine OpenHAB was often slow giving a bad user experience.

OpenHAB community have a hardware FAQ page [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Hardware-FAQ) suggesting BananaPi over RPi due to its SATA connection much more efficient than the microSD.
Personally I decided for the RPi because its vast community and because I did not like the idea to have an additional SATA HDD outide the tiny box.

I decided to get a RPi2b + NOOBS + black case available for â‚¬46,50 from [RS](http://it.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/8772457/?origin=PSF_431027|fp&cm_sp=featureproducts-_-FeaturedProductsContent-_-8772457)

# Connecting to RPi (headless)

Just plug the Ethernet connector to your network and power up the unit providing 5Vdc via the micro USB connector.
The unit is shipped with dynamic IP address and if you have a DHCP server in your LAN it will get a proper IP.
Open your router webpage and look for the assigned IP address, otherwise use [Fing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing&hl=en) application for Android to get the address; you should look for Raspberry Pi Foundation device.

In my case I got 192.168.1.204

By using ssh (on Linux) or Putty (on Windows) you can connect to that IP.

The default root user is 'pi' and the default password is 'raspberry'
When logged in as the pi user you can change your password with the *sudo passwd* command.
Additional information related to user management are available from [this page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/users.md)
