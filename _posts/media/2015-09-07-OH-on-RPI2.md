This tutorial has been written in occasion of my OH installation on a brand new RPi2 model B.
It is meant to be a step by step guide to help myself (and others) in case of new installations.

# Purchasing the hardware

I had a RPi1 model B already running in my apartment with OpenHAB and other backup services.
It was running not very fine, mainly suffering from the slow CPU trying to run the JVM.
On that machine OpenHAB was often slow giving a bad user experience.

OpenHAB community have a hardware FAQ page [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Hardware-FAQ) suggesting BananaPi over RPi due to its SATA connection much more efficient than the microSD.
Personally I decided for the RPi because its vast community and because I did not like the idea to have an additional SATA HDD outide the tiny box.

I decided to get a RPi2b + NOOBS + black case available for â‚¬46,50 from [RS](http://it.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/8772457/?origin=PSF_431027|fp&cm_sp=featureproducts-_-FeaturedProductsContent-_-8772457)

# Configuring the RPi (headless)

## Connecting

Just plug the Ethernet connector to your network and power up the unit providing 5Vdc via the micro USB connector.
The unit is shipped with dynamic IP address and if you have a DHCP server in your LAN it will get a proper IP.
Open your router webpage and look for the assigned IP address, otherwise use [Fing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing&hl=en) application for Android to get the address; you should look for Raspberry Pi Foundation device.

In my case I got 192.168.1.204

By using ssh (on Linux) or Putty (on Windows) you can connect to that IP.
The default root user is 'pi' and the default password is 'raspberry'
You may eventually change the password with *sudo raspi-config* command

## Setting a static IP Address
I followed a really nice guide available [here](http://www.modmypi.com/blog/tutorial-how-to-give-your-raspberry-pi-a-static-ip-address)

And basically I edited the network configuration file with command *sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces*
![dhcp](https://www.modmypi.com/image/data/tutorials/static-ip/tutorial-how-to-give-your-raspberry-pi-a-static-ip-address-2.png)

Simply change the line that reads:

iface eth0 inet *dhcp*

to

iface eth0 inet *static*

Then directly below this line enter the following (Please Note. You will need your own addresses we gathered in Part B, more details below). . . .

address 192.168.1.3

netmask 255.255.255.0

network 192.168.1.0

broadcast 192.168.1.255

gateway 192.168.1.254

sudo rm /var/lib/dhcp/*

Then we'll need to reboot and check your changes. . .

sudo reboot

Log back in and run

ifconfig

Which should reveal your new settings.
