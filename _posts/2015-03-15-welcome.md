**The open-source SmartHome framework to empower your Arduino and Android devices**

*Souliss* is an open-source project that collects code and people with common interest in the field of SmartHome and Internet of Things. It's designed to be light and scalable, runs across multiple nodes and communication media.

You can use Souliss to build an entiere home automation system based on Ethernet and RS485, create your own ZigBee-like wireless intelligent devices or simply to open your garage door from your Android smartphone.

This is the landing page of the Github account, start from here to get started.

-----

Souliss is build in three main parts, listed below:

* [The Arduino Networking Framework](https://github.com/souliss/souliss) : This is the code that runs on your Arduino and compatible boards, it network your boards and is the base structure of your automation system.

* [The Android Application](https://github.com/souliss/soulissapp) : This is an application that can communicate directly with your automation system, it learns from the nodes their features (light, door, windows or whatever they control).

* [The openHAB Binding](https://github.com/souliss/bindingopenhab) : This bind your Souliss nodes with the openHAB automation supervision system, this provide you a server to control your automationa and make advanced schedules. More with openHAB it lets you control multiple vendor system through an unique interface, so that you can use Souliss based devices togheter with other commercial ones.

Is at your option to decide to use the Android Application or the openHAB Binding, you can even use both at same time.

## Get Started

The first step in is a tour in the [wiki](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki), this gives you a detail understanding of the features and capabilities. The most important pages to read are:

* [Supported Hardware Platforms](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/Supported%20Hardware%20Platform) : Identify how you nodes will be build and the communication medias (Ethernet, Wireless point-to-point, RS485).
* [Supported Network Architectures](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/Supported%20Network%20Architecture) : Understand how you can combine multiple communication interface
* [Getting Started](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/Getting%20Started%20with%20Souliss) : Now you are ready to goo deeper, start from the first upload guide.
 
### Required skills

Souliss is quite simple to use, but the following skills are required to get a network up and running. Consider that as average you can get a first node working in less than an hour,

* A general understanding of the Arduino world and its IDE to program the nodes,
* A basic knownledge of electronics and eletricity,
* A little knowledge of networking (basically the IP protocol).

## Build products based on Souliss

You can build nodes with Souliss pre-compiled and loaded, so that people can just install and use it. Souliss code is distributed under license GNU GPLv3, and there is no fee to use it, but you should contribute back if you are modifing the code as per license constrains.
At your option you can require us to re-license the code.

## Community

As open-source project, Souliss based on a community of people that share their work. You are suggested to join the [community](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/Community) to get support and share your result.

## Contribute and Promote

You can contribute and promote Souliss in several ways and isn't required to be a programmer or an electronic designer:

* Share on social media ([twitter](https://twitter.com/soulissteam), [G+](https://plus.google.com/113934123042484468682/posts)) and with friends, show them your Souliss installation and help them to get started
* Partecipate in the [community](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/Community), help other people and share your results
* Fork the code and [contribute](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/Contribute) in the development
* [Donate](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/27771) to support the expenses and development

If you want to share your code, refer to [contribute](https://github.com/souliss/souliss/wiki/Contribute) page in the wiki.

# Enjoy!
